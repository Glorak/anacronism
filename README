Anacronism - an old school way to monitor cron via remote server. Designed for heroku.

Monitoring app runs on heroku, expects a query from your cron at least every MAX_INTERVAL seconds. If an interval is too long, Anacronism sends emails to NOTIFY_LIST. Also sends you a daily email (via "rake cron") if interval is missing at end of day. Does NOT email you about missed individual intervals at present.

Must set environment variables:
HTTP_USER
HTTP_PASSWORD
MAX_INTERVAL (set in seconds)
NOTIFY_LIST (semicolon separated list of email addresses)
EMAIL_FROM (emails come from this address)

Environment variables used/managed by app, must be exported empty in heroku:
LAST_PING_RECEIVED_AT
CONSECUTIVE_EMAILS

Requires free cron & sendgrid addons to be enabled.
