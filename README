Anacronism - an old school way to monitor cron via remote server. Designed for heroku.

The Anacronism monitoring app runs on heroku, expects a ping to "/" with HTTP Basic Auth from your cron at least every MAX_INTERVAL seconds. If an interval is too long, Anacronism sends emails to NOTIFY_LIST. Also sends you a daily email (via "rake cron") if interval is missed at end of day.

Must set environment variables:
HTTP_USER
HTTP_PASSWORD
MAX_INTERVAL (set in seconds)
NOTIFY_LIST (semicolon separated list of email addresses)
EMAIL_FROM (emails come from this address)

Requires free memcached, daily cron & sendgrid addons to be enabled.
